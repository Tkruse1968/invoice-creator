# Saving Invoices to Google Drive - SIMPLIFIED!

## No API Keys Needed Anymore! 

The app has been updated to work with Android's native file system. You don't need to set up any Google API keys or complicated authentication.

## How It Works Now

### On Android Phones:

1. **Create your invoice** as normal
2. **Check the save options** at the bottom:
   - âœ… "Download files to device" - Saves to your Downloads folder
   - âœ… "Share to Google Drive" - Opens Android's share menu

3. **When you tap "Send Invoice":**
   - Files automatically download to your device
   - You get invoice files + QuickBooks files
   - Files go to your Downloads folder

4. **To save to Google Drive:**
   - Option A: Use the "ðŸ“¤ Share" button in the header
   - Option B: After downloading, open your Files app and upload to Drive
   - Option C: Check "Share to Google Drive" before sending

## File Types Created

Every invoice creates these files:
- `INV-001.txt` - Human-readable invoice
- `INV-001_QB2014.csv` - For QuickBooks 2013/2014 import (enhanced data)
- `INV-001_QB2014.iif` - For QuickBooks 2013/2014 import (full invoice with classes)
- `QuickBooks_2013-2014_Import_Instructions.txt` - How to import into QuickBooks

## Android-Specific Features

âœ… **Works Offline** - No internet needed to create/save invoices
âœ… **Native Share Sheet** - Share to any app (Drive, Dropbox, Email, etc.)
âœ… **Downloads Folder** - Easy to find your files
âœ… **No Login Required** - Uses your phone's existing Google account

## Quick Steps for Google Drive

1. Create invoice
2. Tap "ðŸ“¤ Share" button
3. Choose "Drive" from share menu
4. Select folder in your Drive
5. Tap "Save"

That's it! Your invoice and QuickBooks files are in Google Drive.

## For Other Cloud Services

The share button works with ANY app:
- Dropbox
- OneDrive  
- Email
- WhatsApp
- Any cloud storage app

## Troubleshooting

**"Share button doesn't show Google Drive"**
- Make sure Google Drive app is installed
- Check that you're signed into Drive

**"Files don't download"**
- Check your Downloads folder
- Make sure browser has storage permission
- Clear browser cache if needed

**"Want files in a specific Drive folder"**
- Download first, then manually upload to your preferred folder
- Or use the Share button and navigate to the folder

## Benefits of This Approach

âœ… **No Setup Required** - Works immediately
âœ… **Uses Android's Built-in Features** - Native and reliable
âœ… **Works with ALL Cloud Services** - Not just Google Drive
âœ… **Your Data Stays Private** - No third-party access
âœ… **Works Offline** - Save locally, upload later

## Old Method (No Longer Needed)

The previous version required Google Cloud Console setup and API keys. This is NO LONGER NECESSARY. The app now uses Android's native file sharing which is simpler and more secure.

**Note:** If you're using the app on a desktop computer, files will download to your default Downloads folder, and you can manually upload them to Google Drive through your browser.
