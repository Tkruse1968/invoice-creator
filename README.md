# Invoice Creator App

## What This Is
This is a simple app that helps you create invoices for your customers. Think of it like a digital form that makes nice-looking bills you can send to people who owe you money.

## Getting Started

### What You Need First
Before you can use this app, you need to have these things on your computer:
- Node.js (this is like the engine that makes the app run)
- npm (this helps install the parts the app needs)

If you don't have these, ask someone to help you install them from nodejs.org

### Setting Up the App

1. **Open the Terminal** (or Command Prompt on Windows)
   - On Mac: Click the magnifying glass, type "Terminal" and press Enter
   - On Windows: Click Start, type "cmd" and press Enter

2. **Go to the app folder**
   Type this and press Enter:
   ```
   cd invoice-creator
   ```
   (Make sure you're in the right folder first!)

3. **Install what the app needs**
   Type this and press Enter:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   Wait for it to finish (this might take a few minutes)

## Using the App

### To Start the App
Type this in the Terminal and press Enter:
```
npm start
```

The app will open in your web browser automatically. If it doesn't, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

### To Stop the App
Press `Ctrl + C` in the Terminal (hold down Ctrl key and press C)

### To Make a Version for Your Customers
Type this and press Enter:
```
npm run build
```

This creates a folder called "build" with files you can put on a website.

## Common Problems and Fixes

### "Command not found" error
- This means Node.js isn't installed. Get help installing it from nodejs.org

### The app won't start
- Try closing the Terminal and opening it again
- Make sure you're in the right folder (invoice-creator)
- Try running `npm install` again

### Browser shows an error
- Refresh the page (press F5 or click the refresh button)
- Make sure the Terminal is still running the app
- Check if another program is using port 3000
